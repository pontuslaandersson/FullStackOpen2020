#Create a similar diagram depicting the situation where the user creates 
#a new note on page https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes by 
#writing something into the text field and clicking the submit button.

#If necessary, show operations on the browser or on the server as 
#comments on the diagram.

#The diagram does not have to be a sequence diagram. Any sensible way 
#of presenting the events is fine.

#All necessary information for doing this, and the next two exercises, 
#can be found from the text of this part. The idea of these exercises is 
#to read the text through once more, and to think through what is going 
#on there. Reading the application code is not necessary, but it is of 
#course possible.
